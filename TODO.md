  - [] instancing
  - [] d3d11 backend on windows
  
- font module
  - [X] better glyph metric extraction (windows/directwrite)
  - [X] freetype on windows

  - [] get/set audio device latency (wasapi, jack)
  - [] midi (wasapi)
  - [] how to support midi sysex? (jack)
  
- spectrogram example
  - [] lines instead of rectangles
  - [] visualize phase
  - [] add ui
  - [] store spectra per frame, display spectrogram
  - [X] more resilient spectrum caching

- [] logging system
- [] ui layout module
- [] plugin loading system
- [] way of denoting which functions are implemented in another layer
- [] abstract entry point
- [] input fuzzing
- [] profiler
- [] file format parsing/writing module
- [] file streaming
- [] thread pool/wavefront multithreading
- [] pseudo random number generation
- [] clean up os include situation, come up with consistent naming scheme
- [] macos port
- [] port old projects (physical models, granade)
- [] C bindings for VST3 SDK
- [] OpenGL function loading before main

# TODO (August 2025)
- os/gfx module

	- [X] port to windows

- render module
    - [X] fix font glyph blending
	- [X] pull out graphics library depended calls into generalized backend
	- [X] pass pixel coordinates when calling render primatives

	- [] make calling render functions more ergonomic (separate drawing module?)
	- [] instancing
	- [X] port to windows
	
- font module
    - [X] update the font module to match other general modules (font_common files, folder per backend)
	- [X] pull out graphics library dependant calls into  generalized os/gfx or render backend

- audio module
    - [X] get sample rate from audio backend
	- [] support changing sample rate

	- [] port to windows

- spectrogram example
    - [X] compare against python + matplotlib
	- [] lines instead of rectangles
